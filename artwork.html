      <h3>Digital Composition</h3>
      <h5>August 2020</h5>
      <p>This was the very first assignment in our Art 74 class. Our goal was to take 2 different photos/things and combine them using either Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator or both. My Digital Composition was done in Adobe Photoshop and my goal was to stick with the "vaporwave" vibe. I added the Initial D character and changed the colors and added a shadow so that he could blend in with the background more. As well as adding the text on the top.</p>

      <h3>3D MeshMixer Dragon x Angel</h3>
      <h5>September 2020</h5>
      <p>This was a later assignment done in 3D Meshmixer. Our goal was to combine two different things together and make a new object then render it in Adobe 3D Dimensions. In my piece I decided to make it seem like those cool outdoor public sculptures you see in the downtown if a city. I took a pair of angel wings and attached it to an asian dragon using a "burnt metal" material. </p>

      <h3>Glitch Art</h3>
      <h5>September 2020</h5>
      <p>This assignment was probably my favorite. That's because knowing that I can manupulate a photo with it's audio is so crazy. Each photo has it's own unique audio and adding effects made the whole process so fun. With my piece I decided to use Junji's manga art work and add on to it's scary feeling. In the future I would like to do more personal glitch art projects combined with photography.</p>

      <h3>Java Script Digital Illustration</h3>
      <h5>October 2020</h5>
      <p>Our Java Script project was probably the most difficult one to do, my reasoning is because of the coordinate system. It was trial and error when it came to trying to find the right coordinate when trying to make my illustration. This one specifically wasn't so bad because the code was very repetitive. This illustration was meant to be a chill summer in Japan type of feel. </p>

      <h3>Java Script Self Portrait</h3>
      <h5>October 2020</h5>
      <p>This is my interenet persona which is me stuffed in my green hoodie. As previously mentioned I had a fairly difficult time with Java Script, specifically the coordination system. I had a difficult time when it came to making a self portrait because it was endless trial and error trying to find the right point for the 2D primitives. </p>

      <h3>Vibes (Photo of piece)</h3>
      <h5>September 2020</h5>
      <p>This piece was done in Adobe Illustrator. Unfortunately due to technical difficulties I was not able to grab the original file. Luckily, I had a photo of it saved. This was a warm up that ended up being a serious art piece that I am very proud of. I was inspired by vaporwave but decided to use colors that I really liked, pink, turquoise and yellow. I really like how I layered the piece giving it depth and aesthtically pleasing to the eye.</p>

      <h3>KDA Ahri from League of Legends</h3>
      <h5>September 2020</h5>
      <p>Now comes the digital illustrations I have done and are very proud of. This is fan art of KDA Ahri from the game League of Legends. I drew this when their latest song "The Baddest" came out. On my social media I posted the other members as well but felt more attached to this piece specifically. This was done in drawing application "Medibang".</p>

      <h3>Genshin Impact OC</h3>
      <h5>October 2020</h5>
      <p>Lately, I've been playing the game "Genshin Impact" and was inspired to make my own character. This is my own characater named "Jun" he is a pyro character who uses an épéé as his main weapon. I wanted to challenge myself when it came to character design and still have much to learn. This was also done in the drawing application "Medibang".</p>

      <h5>September 2020</h5>
      <p>This is fanart of the character Yumeko Jabami from the anime "Kakegurui". I am very proud of the way this piece game it, I still have a lot to learn especially when it comes to coloring. I am currently trying to improve my clothing coloring style. This was done in the drawing application "Medibang".</p>

      <h3>Ouran High School Host Club</h3>
      <h5>April 2020</h5>
      <p>This piece was one that took the longest because it's a groupd drawing of the main characters from the anime "Ouran High School Host Club." Back when I drew this piece, it helped me discover new ways in my coloring style more so the way I color hair. This was done in the drawing application "Medibang".</p>

<h1 style="font-family: Time New Roman"> Artist Statement</h1>

<p style="font-family: Time New Roman">   When it comes to my artwork and how I express it, it  all depends on the medium, how I feel that day, and the things that motivate and inspire me. I like to make things that either have deep feelings intertwined with it, some regular fan art just for the fun of it and many others. I don’t want my art to be tied down into one specific genre and type, I enjoy expressing myself in different forms of art. When I create my art I would want my audience to feel enjoyment and euphoria, especially if it’s a drawing of a character that many people know. If I were to put out a piece that I pour my heart and soul into I would want my audience to look into it and understand my feelings. At the same time I would want to scare my audience too. What I want is all over the place as you’ve noticed. As I mentioned before I am open to different types of genres when it comes to art. I want to send out different messages depending on my mood and “go with the 
flow”. That is why in my “Artworks” page not every piece has the same vibe and feeling to it. In a way I want to reach different audiences and not have the same one every time. </p>

<br>

  <p style="font-family: Time New Roman">I am mainly a digital illustrator, in today’s art society digital illustrators are very big when it comes to social media, company collaborations, and generally very independent. Digital illustrators are especially given more exposure on the social media platform “Instagram”. There are many artists there that I look up to and who have helped me develop my regular go-to art style. Without all that inspiration in one little app I wouldn't be where I am today. With my experience, I want young artists to understand that we all start somewhere. I’ve gotten many questions on “how do I draw so well” and the questions fairly simple, I just practiced. Never stopped drawing. I enjoy doing art improvement comparisons to really send young artists that exact message. Not everyone is born with such talent, but we can practice our way to develop it.</p>

  <br>

  <p style="font-family: Time New Roman">I’d like to start messing around with photography and glitch effects. Just learning how to manipulate pictures by it’s audio was really interesting and I plan on continuing more glitch art. With glitch art the set of pieces would be more on the scary and deep meaning side. Creating my own drawing and glitching it afterwards to see the effects would be the most satisfying thing ever. Despite my love for drawing people I would want to start creating more meaningful art in the near future using different forms of digital art. When making art you want to make sure you’re in the right headspace, and what I mean by that is that you’re motivated. When forcing yourself you end up not making pieces you’re not proud of. It’s good to look around and seek for inspiration. I’ve always struggled with art block and sometimes a song, looking at other artists and what they’ve done and then soon I’ll feel so inspired there’s just so many things I could do.</p>
